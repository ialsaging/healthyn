This document contains the plot of predicted probabilities from each individual study, as well as the weighted average effect, from the cross-sectional analyses.

# Code

The following packages were used to generate this figure: 

```{r ref.label = "load_packages", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'hide', eval = F}
```

The files needed for this table are available at [osf.io/mzfu9](https://osf.io/mzfu9/) in the Meta Analysis Output folder.

First we load the meta-analysis objects. To see how these objects were created, see the meta-analysis script titled `active_meta-analysis.R` that are available at [osf.io/zvsfb](https://osf.io/zvsfb/).

```{r ref.label = "load_data", eval = F}
```

We plot the values.

```{r ref.label = "plot", fig.height= 9, eval = F}

```
