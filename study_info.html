<h2>Base II</h2>
<p>The Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) consists of a subsample of younger (20-35 years of age) and a subsample of older adults (60-84 years of age) who were recruited from the greater metropolitan area of Berlin via advertisements in public transportation systems and regional newspapers as well as through a participant pool at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development (for overview, see Bertram et al., 2014; Gerstorf et al., 2016). Starting in 2009, a total of 1,954 participants (younger adults = 472; older adults = 1,482) completed at least one and up to four waves of personality and health measures.</p>

<h2>EAS</h2>
<p>The Einstein Aging study (EAS) is a longitudinal cohort study of cognitive aging and dementia, beginning in 1993. Older adults who were at least 70 years of age, non-institutionalized, and English speaking were systematically recruited from an urban, multi-ethnic, community-dwelling population in Bronx County, NY.

The study includes comprehensive psychiatric, psychological, cognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic, and neuroimaging assessments, which capture a wide range of physical and psychological health markers, as well as lifestyle, social, and health-economic factors that contribute to ageing. Included in the measurement of psychological variables in OATS was the assessment of personality, which was measured at baseline using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; Costa &amp; McRae, 1992). The longitudinal twin cohort design enables the disentanglement of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to, and moderate the role of risk factors, on the ageing process. At present, three waves, each spaced two years apart, have been completed, although due to cohort attrition, only 391 participants from the initial cohort have completed the third wave.

<p>The HRS used the Midlife Development Inventory Personality Scales (MIDI; Lachman &amp; Weaver, 1997) for assessment of personality traits. This is an adjective measure in which respondents evaluated how well each adjective described them on a scale from 1 (A lot) to 4 (Not at all). Responses were reverse coded for analyses, such that higher numbers indicated that an adjective was more representative of the respondent. Each trait was assessed using the following adjective items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neuroticism - moody, worrying, nervous, calm (reverse-scored)</li>
<li>Conscientiousness - organized, responsible, hardworking, careless (reverse-scored), thorough</li>
<li>Extraversion - outgoing, friendly, lively active, talkative</li>
<li>Agreeableness - helpful, warm, caring, softhearted, sympathetic</li>
<li>Openness - creative, imaginative, intelligent, curious, broad-minded, sophisticated, adventurous</li>
</ul>

Participants rated their level of agreement for each item a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). For the chronic conditions study, baseline personality data was collected in 2000. For the mortality and health behaviors studies, baseline personality data was collected in 1994 for panels 1 and 2 and 2000 for panel 3.</p>

Participants were asked questions regarding the frequency (more than once per week, once a week, 1-3 times a month, hardly ever or never) and vigor (mild, moderate, vigorous) of participation in physical activities. The items were first re-coded so that higher values indicated more exercise, and then summed to represent the frequency of physical activity (note: this variable computation did not include giving more weight to activities dependent on vigor).</p>

Journal of Studies on Alcohol, 59, 712-722. (need citations?) Drinking behavior was assessed by mail in 1991, in which participants were asked the total number of drinks they typically drank per day. Smoking was assessed during the in-person exam, and participants indicated their current smoking status (1=never, 2=quit, 3=regular, 4=occasional, 5= current). This was recoded for the current project so that only individuals who endorsed currently smoking (5) were considered smokers. Physical activity was assessed using the Health and Social Behavior Survey, in which participants indicated the amount of physical activity they participated in weekly (1=DAILY 2=3-4 TIMES A WEEK 3=ONCE OR TWICE WEEK 4=2-3 TIMES MONTH 5=ONCE A MONTH 6=LESS ONCE A MONTH 7=NEVER) ## OATS Smoking status at baseline (0 = not smoking, 1 = currently smoking) was determined using multiple questions in the baseline medical history questionnaire. Specifically, participants who reported never having smoked (on a variable labelled “smoke_ever”) at wave 1 where coded as not smoking on this variable. Participants that had smoked previously (on the variable “smoke_ever”) but reported an age where they stopped smoking at wave 1 (on a variable called “smoke_stop_age”) that was younger than their current age (on the variable “age_eachwave”) were also coded as not smoking. Participants that reported that they had smoked previously (on the “smoke_ever” variable“) but did not report an age when they stopped smoking at wave 1 (on”smoke_stop_age“) were coded as currently smoking. Participants that reported they had smoked previously (on the variable”smoke_ever“) and that they had smoked in the last month (on a variable called”smoke_last_month“) were coded as currently smoking. Drinking status at baseline (0 = non-drinker, 1 = drinker) was determined using the following rules: If the participant reported that he/she drunk alcohol in the last year (on a variable”alcohol_freq“) then they were categorized as a drinker. Alternatively, if the participant reported that he/she had never drunk alcohol (on a variable”alcohol_ever&quot; or that he/she had not drunk alcohol in the last year (on a variable “alcohol_freq”), then they were coded as a non-drinker. Physical activity was assessed with a detailed lifestyle questionnaire. Firstly, participants rated how many times in the last month they engaged in sporting activities on a 1 (never did this activity) to 5 (5 or more times) scale. Participants were also asked how many times per week, for more than 15 minutes, they engaged in (i) strenuous exercise (running, jogging, hockey, football, soccer, squash, basketball, cross country skiing, judo, roller skating, vigorous swimming, vigorous long-distance bicycling), moderate exercise (e.g., fast walking, baseball, tennis, easy bicycling, volleyball, badminton, easy swimming, alpine skiing, popular and folk dancing) and mild/light exercise (e.g., yoga, archery, fishing from a river bank, bowling, horseshoes, golf, snowmobiling, easy walking). Finally, participants were asked to rate a series of individual exercises in terms of the (i) the number of times they performed each activity per week for more than 15 minutes, and (ii) the amount of time they performed each activity (using the following scale: 1: less than 1 hour a week; 2: 1-2.5 hours a week; 3: 3-4.5 hours a week; 4: 5-6.5 hours a week; 5: 7-8.5 hours a week; and 6: 9 or more hours a week. Participants reporting that they engaged in at least one exercise/physical activity, or reporting having engaged in strenuous, moderate, and/or light exercise at least once a week were coded as 1 = active (otherwise, participants were coded as inactive).</p>

<p>All health behaviors were self-reported and assessed at every wave. Smoking was assessed by asking participants “Do you currently smoke?” (yes/no). Physical activity was assessed by asking participants how many hours per week they pursued different kinds of physical activities (e.g., dancing, walking, hiking, participant sports,…). For the current analysis, answers were converted into a dichotomous variable, with 0 indicating that a participant did not engage in any physical exercise and 1 indicating that a participant practiced any kind of sport. Alcohol consumption was assessed by asking participants to indicate the number of alcoholic drinks (liquor shots, beer, wine) they drank last week. For the current analysis, participants who indicated that they drank more than more than 7 (women) or 14 (men) glasses per week were categorized as heavy drinkers, those who reported to consume less than that were categorized as non-heavy drinkers.</p>

<h2>WLS</h2>
<p>Frequency of smoking, drinking, and physical activity were self-reported at each wave. Participants were coded as 1 if they indicated that they currently smoke regularly (otherwise 0). Participants indicated how much they currently smoke in terms of average number of packs per day, which was converted into number of cigarettes per day using a standard of 20 cigarettes/pack. Responses for cigars or pipe tobacco were assigned a value of 1 unit/day. Current drinking was assessed via one item asking participants to estimate the number of days in the past month in which they consumed alcohol.</p>
<p>Participants who indicated that they had consumed alcohol in the past month were coded as drinkers (drinkers = 1, non-drinkers = 0). Average alcohol consumption was assessed from the item “What is the average number of drinks you had on the days you consumed any alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, liquor, or mixed alcoholic drinks in the past month?” Those who did not drink in the past month were given a value of 0.</p>
<p>At baseline (1993), physical activity was assessed using two items: “How often do you participate in light physical activity such as walking, dancing, gardening, golfing, bowling, etc.?” and “How often do you participate in vigorous physical exercise or sports such as aerobics, running, swimming, bicycling, etc.?”. This was originally coded as 1 = three or more times per week, 2 = once or twice per week, 3 = about one to three times per month, 4 = one or fewer times per month. These were rescaled to indicate how often participants engaged in these activities per month (three time per week = 12 times/month, once or twice per week = 6 per month, etc.) and the two variables were combined. The resulting variable approximates how often participants engage in light or vigorous physical activity in an average month.</p>
<p>For the 2004 and 2011 waves, this variable was constructed from four variables asking participants to estimate the number of hours/month in the past year they spent engaging in: light physical activity alone (e.g. light housework, gardening, or walking by yourself), light PA with others (walking with friends, bowling, playing softball or other team sports with light activity), vigorous PA alone (jogging, swimming, biking, or going to the gym by yourself), and vigorous PA with others (jogging, swimming, biking, or going to the gym with friends or playing team sports). These items were averaged to create an item reflecting the overall average number of hours per month spent engaging in physical activity.</p>

<p>Chronic conditions were assessed at every wave. Participants were asked to indicate if they had ever been diagnosed with any chronic condition listed (0 = no; 1 = yes). Some diseases were included in every wave (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, heart condition, stroke) while others were only included in some waves (e.g., asthma, lung disease, back pain, osteoporosis, and others). If participants endorsed any condition (other than diabetes, hypertension, and heart condition) or the “other chronic condition” option, they were marked as 1 (having a chronic condition), if they endorsed none of the conditions and the “no chronic condition” option, they were marked as 0 (not having a chronic condition). If participants did not endorse any of the conditions nor the “other chronic condition” or the “no chronic condition” option, data was assumed missing.</p>
